The snake AI is developed by three approaches-
1. Using path searching algorithms like A*, reverse A*

2. Using Deep learning with Neural Networks. Trained using first approach along with manual training.

3. Using genetic evolution (Deep NeuroEvolution), which is a alternative of reinforcement learning. Here the snakes will follow the darwin law (Survival of the fittest), evolve and gradually learn to play. There are 20 snakes playing at once (known as a generation). Each snake has it's unique brain which is a neural network. The snakes which survies the best in this generation will have more ability to pass its characteristics (or genes) to the next generation (This is analogus to natural selection). Thus, a new generation formed will have more developed brains than the previous generation. The new generation also change their inherited genes a little bit so that they can discover new survival possibilities. (This is analogus to mutation). The snakes are partially trained already, and you can see the snakes performing better as time passes.
